# Predictive-model-for-HCC-samples
The project created a machine learning model for predictive modelling to screen candidate biomarkers and find utility for diagnosis in tissue and serum. It is able to classify hepatocellular carcinoma samples from normal to the tumour, based on RNA-seq expression values of protein-coding RNAs. This also aided in biomarker discovery.
